        <h4>Lily</h4>
    <p>The lily is a genus of flowering plant. There are many species of lilies, like trumpet lilies and tiger lilies. They are usually quite tall, and are perennials.
        Most lilies grow from a bulb, which in some species develops into a rhizome, which carries small bulbs.</p></div>
        <div class="flo">
            <h4>Buttercup</h4>
        <p>Plant Buttercups are mostly perennial, but occasionally annual or biennial, herbaceous, aquatic or terrestrial plants, often with leaves in a rosette at the base of the stem. In many perennial species runners are sent out that will develop new plants with roots and rosettes at the distanced nodes.</p></div>
            <div class="flo">
                <h4>Delphinium</h4>
            <p>Delphinium is a genus of about 300 species of annual and perennial flowering plants in the family Ranunculaceae, native throughout the Northern Hemisphere and also on the high mountains of tropical Africa. The genus was erected by Carl Linnaeus.

     <p class="para1">Most flowering plants depend on animals, such as bees, moths, and butterflies, to transfer their pollen between different flowers, and have evolved to attract these pollinators by various strategies, including brightly colored, conspicuous petals, attractive scents, and the production of nectar, a food source for pollinators.[2] In this way, many flowering plants have co-evolved with pollinators be mutually dependent on services they provide to one anotherâ€”in the plant's case, a means of reproduction; in the pollinator's case, a source of food.[3] After fertilization, the ovary of the flower develops into fruit containing seeds.</p>
     <p class="para2">Flower is from the Middle English flour, which referred to both the ground grain and the reproductive structure in plants, before splitting off in the 17th century. It comes originally from the Latin name of the Italian goddess of flowers, Flora. The early word for flower in English was blossom,[4] though it now refers to flowers only of fruit trees.[5]</p>
     <p class="para3">A floral formula is a way to represent the structure of a flower using specific letters, numbers, and symbols, presenting substantial information about the flower in a compact form. It can represent a taxon, usually giving ranges of the numbers of different organs, or particular species. Floral formulae have been developed in the early 19th century and their use has declined since. Prenner et al. (2010) devised an extension of the existing model to broaden the descriptive capability of the formula</p>
